# Building Imba for static hosting

This is a starting point for building Imba to be hosted statically. It can also be used to build Imba into a native app with [imbutter](https://github.com/codeluggage/imbutter).

Original `build.js` script is here: <https://gist.github.com/trafnar/05ebbf0f5193e69f998f41b154d18190>

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.

Note that `dist/html` is the static version.
